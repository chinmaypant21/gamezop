The Assignment:
Your task is to develop a responsive website inspired by https://www.gamezop.com. While this assignment draws inspiration from Gamezop, we encourage you to bring your unique creative vision to the table. The objective is not to replicate the website but to craft an innovative and original interpretation based on your expertise in front-end software engineering.
To assist you in this assignment, we provide you with the following API: "https://pub.gamezop.com/v3/games?id=peSLSV". This API gives you a list of games that you can utilize in your application.

Technical Requirements:
The project should be built using Next.js and TypeScript.
Incorporate Progressive Web App (PWA) functionality into your application.
Your app should have a well-structured directory and exhibit features demonstrating best industry practices.
You are expected to leverage React Suspense for handling asynchronous operations, including data fetching.
Implement Server Components to efficiently render components server-side and send them to the client.

Non-Technical Requirements:
You don't need to incorporate every element of the original website in your version. For example, advertisements do not need to be rendered.
The final output should be a responsive website, ensuring a seamless user experience across various devices.

Deployment and Submission:
Upload your final project to a public GitHub repository. The repository should be well-organized and include a README file that articulates your development process, your decision-making journey, and instructions on how to run the project locally.
Deploy the website using Vercel. The link to the live website should be included in your submission.
